# DEDUCTED

A 1-bit, third-person descent through a dystopian megastructure, where every passage has a price and the only thing you have left to sell is yourself.

Made in one week for the 15th 1-BIT game jam. https://itch.io/jam/1-bit-jam-15
**Theme:** *Everything has a price* · **Limitation:** *1-bit (black and white only)*

## Concept

You are released from a facility with no memory and an almost empty account. To move through the city, you pay tolls at gates. To pay tolls, you sell your body to corporate terminals, or swap parts for synthetic replacements that charge you by the second.

- **Sell** a part to VITALIS Reclamation: more money, lose the ability for good
- **Swap / ** a part at CONTINUUM Prosthetics: keep the ability, pay a subscription
- **Pay** the Passage Authority to open gates

Fall into debt and the collectors come for what's left of you. There are no revives. Learn the city, learn the deals, and find the route up.

## Controls

| Input | Action |
